What is a Career?
A job is a short-term position that allows you to earn money. A career is different from a job in that it is a long-term professional journey. A career can be made up of many jobs that develop many different skills over time. Those who pursue a career seek to build upon what they know by setting goals and actively working to achieve those goals.

Consider this scene from Lewis Carroll's story Alice Through the Looking Glass:

Image of Alice asking the Cheshire cat which road to take. "Where do you want to go?" he says. "I don't know," she responds. "Then it doesn't matter."

In the same way, if you want a career, you must choose where you want to go. This means actively setting goals that build your skills. There will be many choices along the path that will determine your destination.

Where do you want to go? What are your goals? What skills will you need to achieve those goals? What skills do you have now, and which ones do you need to acquire?

Consider these eternal principles as you seek to discover your unique gifts and how God wants you to use them to build His kingdom.

Covenant-Related Contributions
As disciples of Jesus Christ, we covenant to "...mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places" (Mosiah 18:9Links to an external site.). We covenant to serve our fellow man with the talents we've been given. We can choose to make our life's work meaningful through covenant-related contributions. These are choices that ultimately serve God and His children. If we make choices that align with our covenants, we can become the disciple leaders God wants us to be.

Your Place of Work
Students taking this course come from a variety of backgrounds. They have a variety of needs. Note the following situations and consider which one is closest to yours:

Active job-seekers, looking for a job right now.
Future job-seeker.
Entrepreneur who already has a business or wants to start one. In this course, those who work for themselves are considered entrepreneurs.
Non-job-seekers or non-entrepreneurs who do not intend to get a job or start or grow a business.
Unsure about any of the above.
No matter what your situation is, you have a place of work. Life in general is a place of work. You must work to take care of your stewardships. This includes the stewardships of being an employee, entrepreneur, parent, grandparent, sibling, volunteer, and so on. This course, called Introduction to Career Development, will require you to take steps to advance a career. If you are not a job-seeker or an entrepreneur, you can still apply the assignments in this course to your place of work. For example, someone who is a non-job-seeker can still complete a résumé in case they ever need to be a job-seeker in the future, or so they can help others within their stewardship complete a résumé. No matter what your situation, apply the lessons and activities in this course to your place of work.
